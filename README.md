# 🚀 Docker Projects & Experiments 🐳

Welcome to the **Docker Projects Repository**!  
This collection features **Dockerized applications** across **ML apps, databases, networking experiments, and AWS deployments**.  

Each project demonstrates **real-world containerization use cases**, helping you master **Docker for development and cloud environments**. 🚀

## 📚 Learning Resources

Here are some of my go-to references for Docker and cloud learning:

- 📖 [Official Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- 🎥 [Docker YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Docker)
- 📜 [Docker Cheat Sheet (Collabnix)](https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/docker/cheatsheet/)

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before diving into the projects:

- ✅ **Docker** → `docker --version`
- ✅ **Python** (for Streamlit-based apps)
- ✅ **AWS CLI** (for EC2 deployments)
